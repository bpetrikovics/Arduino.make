# Arduino Makefile #

Makefile to aid Arduino development under a Linux environment, originally developed by
Tim Marston (http://ed.am).

I've "forked" it because I've sent some changes/suggestions to the author in 2016, but have
never received a response. However I still wanted to track my changes and thought others
might benefit from it as well. The license text at least suggested the author did not oppose
to such practice.
